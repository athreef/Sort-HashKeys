=head1 NAME

Sort::HashKeys - Get a sorted-by-key list from a hash


    =head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sort::HashKeys;

    my %hash;

    @sorted_1 = map { ($_, $hash{$_}) } sort keys %hash;
    @sorted_2 = Sort::HashKeys::sort(%hash);
    # Same outcome, but the second is faster

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    [13:37:51]  <a3f>	Is there a better way to get a sorted list out of a hash than map { ($_, $versions{$_}) } reverse sort keys @versions or iterating manually?
    [13:39:06]  <a3f>	oh I could provide a compare function to sort and chunk the list two by two..
    [13:40:15]  <haarg>	i'd probably go with the map{} reverse sort keys
    [13:41:04]  <a3f>	I don't like it that it repeats the lookup for all keys. Of course wouldn't matter in practice but stillâ€¦
    [13:43:40]  <haarg>	whatever other solution you find will be slower

=head1 BENCHMARK

    See C<benchmark.pl> in this distribution. Each test was run on a Haswell 2.6 GHz i5 CPU (4278U) for a minute on a copy of a randomly generated hash of 1000 keys. Keys were alphanumeric with length between 1 and 6 and values of integers between 1 and 1000.

                                         Rate
    map {($_,$h{$_})} sort keys %h     1830/s        --      -27%
    Sort::HashKeys::sort(%h)           2503/s       37%        --

37% faster.

One could do better by operating in-place, instead of copying off the pointers, but I'll leave that for another time. (or leave it to you! Send me your patch!)

=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item sort(@)

Sorts a hash-like list (C<< (key1 => val1, key2 => val2>) >> by means of your libc's 
L<http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strcmp> in ascending order. If an odd number of elements was passed in, an C<undef> is appended.

Providing a sort function not yet supported.

=item reverse_sort(@)

Sorts in descending order.
